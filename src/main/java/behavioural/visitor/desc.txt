Main objective of VISITOR design pattern is to add the functionality to class at run time.
Could you clear above statement by giving any solid example ?
--
Let we do have different product like Shirt, TShirt, Kurta, Pajama etc. every items here has some price.
Lets someone want to calculate the tax of individual item on fly or lets someone want to calculate benefit or profit
to individual item on fly.
For that what do you do ?
There is two approach -
1. You can go to every class and add functionality of require type to each class and done.
2. You can create the dedicated different class for each functionality and you can invoke the functionality of
functionality class of require object at run time.

Technique 1:
It not feasible good approach to go in each class and add the functionality whenever you want to add new function.

Technique 2:
This is good approach because we segregate the functionality in different class and invoke that functionality from
appropriate class as require. ( This is visitor design pattern ).
