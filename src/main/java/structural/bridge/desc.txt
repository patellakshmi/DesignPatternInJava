Intent
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
Publish interface in an inheritance hierarchy, and bury implementation in its own inheritance hierarchy.
Beyond encapsulation, to insulation

Problem
"Hardening of the software arteries" has occurred by using subclassing of an abstract base class to provide
alternative implementations. This locks in compile-time binding between interface and implementation.
The abstraction and implementation cannot be independently extended or composed.

The Bridge design pattern proposes refactoring this exponentially explosive inheritance hierarchy into two orthogonal
hierarchies â€“ one for platform-independent abstractions, and the other for platform-dependent implementations.
